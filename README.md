# Streaming Analytics Studies

A set of studies for IBM Streaming Analytics IBM Cloud or ICP 4 Data.

* [TradesApp folder](.TradesApp/README.md) includes one application to deploy to IBM Streaming Analytics on IBM Cloud and one to run on the local instance. The graph reads a csv file and then applies filters, and then calculates the average, maximum and minimum ask price for each of the stocks. See [this blog](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/) to understand how the flow is built.
